            <p class="project">During the 2018-2019 academic school year, I was fortunate to be part of a multi-campus team between Centre College and Murray State University researching graph labelings thanks to a National Science Foundation CURM grant (DMS-1722563).<br>
            My team, consisting of another Centre student and a student from Murray State University, compiled our results on the prime labelings of snake graphs into an article published with the PUMP Undergraduate Journal of Mathematics in August of 2019.<br>
            Additionally, another paper detailing the undergraduate research experience was published in the Math Horizons journal in January of 2020.<br>
            Both journal articles are available upon request.</p>
