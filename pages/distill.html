            <p class="project">During the Spring semester of 2020, I was given the opportunity to work with one of the top 15 bourbon distillers in the world as a part of the Industrial Mathematics course offered by Centre College (MAT 493). During this course, I was assigned to a four person team tasked with modeling the costs of the bourbon aging process as well as estimating demand for the distillery's products. <br>
            My team worked to create a program in R that modeled the evaporative loss of barrels of bourbon stored over a number of years and estimated the value of the given barrel knowing how much product it was able to produce at the end of the aging process. Moving forward, the goal is to incorporate this program with another program that reflects the changing value of product as production changes supplies.</p>
