                <p class="project">Over the Fall semester of 2019, I was able to take the Anthropology/Sociology Research Methods course with Dr. Wiles at Centre College (ANT/SOC 305). As a part of this course to reinforce good research methodology, the twelve person group partnered with a local non-profit to create evaluative research of the non-profit's community building and attempted to quantify progress towards their mission statement to end food insecurity.<br>
            During this project, I worked with the research group to conduct field observations and interviews as well as write, distribute, and analyze a survey to over 200 people. Analysis was done in Python and SPSS, and visualization was done in Python.<br>
            Results were presented to the non-profit stakeholders in late November, 2019. </p>
