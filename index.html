            <p class="about">I'm a rising senior at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. I am expected to graduate in May of 2021 with a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics with a Data Science minor. During my time as a student at Centre, I've had the luck to work on several research projects, which you can explore on the Projects page. Please enjoy the results of each of these projects!</p>
